# Postgrest
A thin API client on top of Postgres.

# About
This is a Heroku-specific deploy configuration for the [Postgrest](https://postgrest.com/en/v4.4/) application.

There isn't any app-specific code in here, it is strictly Heroku deploy configuration code. I don't imagine this repo will need to be updated often, if ever.
